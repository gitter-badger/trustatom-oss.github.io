{"name":"Trustatom Opensource","tagline":"","body":"### Trustatom Open Source\r\nTrustatom could not have existed without those vast amounts of open source. Our products stay on the shoulders of giants. We are happy to have an opportunity to contribute, both to new and existing projects. We'll be soon publishing some of our work on [GitHub](https://github.com/trustatom-oss).\r\n\r\n### Bounties\r\nWe use cutting edge technologies and stacks. They have much better at survival and proliferation if there is enough of quality libraries available. We build our extended open source team through bounties. Check them out!\r\n\r\n#### Bounty 1: Bitcoin Elliptic Curve for Elixir (suggested amount: 3 BTC)\r\nThere's some basic ECDSA support in Erlang's `crypto` module. But that's not enough for using it to sign Bitcoin transactions. As an example, there's a fairly good implementation in [Go](https://github.com/conformal/btcec) with a decent test coverage.\r\n\r\nGot the chops or questions? Email us at opensource@trustatom.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
